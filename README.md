## 🔎 Real Problem We Solve (Personal Story)

*"I once bought a course on a Web2 platform like Udemy, completed it, and downloaded the certificate. Later, while applying for a blockchain internship, I submitted this certificate. But the recruiter asked me, 'Can you prove this is real?' That hit me. Anyone can fake a PDF. There's no public proof or ownership."*

**Web2 Certificate Issues:**

* Can be easily edited/faked (e.g., in Photoshop)
* No public verification mechanism
* No ownership or on-chain record


**We built SkillBridge to fix this.**

**Web3 NFT Certificates:**

* Minted on-chain to your wallet
* Publicly verifiable
* Tamper-proof and immutable

We also solved another pain point:

> "During online courses, whenever I had doubts, I commented under the video. Often, no one responded or it took days. It felt disconnected."

**So we added:**

* 🧠 **AI-powered chatbots per course** trained on that course's content
* ⏱ Instant doubt solving
* 📊 No waiting for instructors
